# Multiple Choice Quiz project
This project is to develop a web based program that helps in dealing with quiz assessments.
There are some user's stories that the program can address at the moment:

As a __TEACHER__, I would like to give examination to my students in a quiz format with following features:
- A quiz have many questions.
- A question can be:
    1. Answered by a single choice or
    2. Multiple choices or
    3. Open for student to write his/her own answer
- Questions can have difference score and evaluation method (automatic, manual), depending on their complexity.
- I can put an suggestion or answer to each question to support evaluation process or student review after their examination.
- I can set time constraint to the quiz.
- I can define many examinations base on one quiz.
- I can control the status (attend-able, work submission only, completed) of the examination.
- I can shuffle:
    1. Questions in the quiz
    2. Both questions in the quiz and choices in the question
- My students can take an examination base on a secrete code that I disclose to them

As a __STUDENT__, I would like to:
- Take the examination with a "room code" that I get from my teacher. My email address and the room code are all I need to take the exam.
- In case that I refresh the page or close my web browser accidentally, I can get back to the place where I have just left.
